title: GIS Software
---

The ecosystem of GIS software is quite large and complex, with new software
being developed everyday. This page focuses on applications that integrate
multiple pieces of GIS software to create a single desktop or server
application. Resources for other GIS software, including spatial databases can
be found [here](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/databases/),
while resources for geospatial libraries/packages can be found with their
associated programming languages.

## ArcGIS Pro

Developed by Esri, ArcGIS Pro succeeded ArcMap and as the foundation to Esri's
extraordinarily popular ecosystem of GIS software. It is by far the most popular
and commonly used commercial GIS desktop application.

All UBC Students can access ArcGIS Pro through the UBC Library labs documented
in their [GIS research guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/gis/labs). Students,
who are enrolled in a geography course that requires access to ArcGIS Pro, will
also have access to the
[Geography Computer Labs](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).
Additionally, students may purchase a discounted one-year license for using
ArcGIS Pro on their personal computers from the
[UBC GIS Software page](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/).

UBC Geography maintains a department license for all ArcGIS software, which is
available to all faculty, staff, and researchers.

ArcGIS Pro is developed exclusively around Windows, so running it on a Mac or
Linux device requires either the ability to dual boot into a Windows operating
system or access to Windows from a virtual environment. Esri provides these
[instructions](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/run-pro-on-a-mac.htm)
for Mac users.

## QGIS

QGIS is a free and open-source GIS desktop application with broad support for
Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Its development is supported by the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), which also supports other popular
geospatial software, like GDAL, GEOS, GrassGIS, PostGIS, and many others. You
can download and install QGIS from their
[download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) or, if you are
a UBC Vancouver student, you can access it from one of the labs listed in
[UBC Library's GIS Research Guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/gis/labs).

The UBC Library Research Commons frequently provides introductory workshops on
QGIS for students, faculty, and staff. You can review previous workshop
materials below and find upcoming workshops on their
[calendar](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/calendar/vancouver?t=g&q=qgis).

## GeoServer

GIS servers, like ArcGIS Server, QGIS Server, and GeoServer, enable users to
publish and share their maps and geospatial data through web-hosted services.
Similar to QGIS, GeoServer has been supported as an OSGeo project. It supports
the following standard protocols: Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service
(WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS) alongside Web Processing Service (WPS) and
Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) via added extensions. It also provides the back-end
for the geospatial content management system, GeoNode.

While GeoServer can be hosted on a virtual machine through the
[Alliance Cloud](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/cloud-computing/#digital-research-alliance-dra),
we strongly recommend that you review and consider deploying
[cloud-optimized geospatial formats](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/) with
[object storage](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/cloud-computing/object-storage.html)
as an alternative if your use case allows it.
