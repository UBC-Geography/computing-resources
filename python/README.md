# Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its low
learning curve paired with a massive ecosystem has made it a powerful tool for
geospatial computing. GIS software like QGIS and ArcGIS, provide the ability to
extend their functionality through Python, while many programming libraries that
have been created to efficiently perform geospatial computing tasks have been
either written in Python, released as Python packages, and/or include
application programming interfaces (APIs) that coherently communicate with
Python code.

## Linting

Using a static analysis tool, or linter, is a common best practice among
programmers that helps in identifying and fixings mistakes when writing code by
ensuring that you follow the correct syntax and a guiding set of best practices.

- [flake8 Documentation](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

## Type Checking

While Python is inherently a dynamically typed language, meaning you the
programmer don't have to worry about the data types of each variable, static
types can be helpful for reducing bugs when writing complex scripts or programs.
Mypy enables programmers to annotate types into their code and returns a helpful
error when those types aren't explicitly followed.

## Formatting

Sometimes writing code can get a bit messy. Formatters, like black, can
automatically reformat your code to make it cleaner and easier to read while
following a set of standards and best practices.

- [black Documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Testing Framework

Similar to type checking, unit testing can be a helpful tool when writing large
and complex scripts or programs. Testing frameworks, like pytest, which is
included in Python's standard library, enable you to define tests that can run
over your functions and ensure they are following expected behavior in a range
of practical scenarios.
