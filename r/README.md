## Formatting

Sometimes writing code can get a bit messy. Formatters, like styler, can
automatically reformat your code to make it cleaner and easier to read while
following a set of standards and best practices.

Note: RStudio includes a formatting tool via Code \> Reformat Code

- [styler Documentation](https://styler.r-lib.org/)

## Linting

Using a static analysis tool, or linter, is a common best practice among
programmers that helps identify mistakes when writing code by ensuring that you
follow the correct syntax and a guiding set of best practices.

- [lintr Documentation](https://lintr.r-lib.org/)

## Testing Framework

Similar to type checking, unit testing can be a helpful tool when writing large
and complex scripts or programs. Testing frameworks enable you to define tests
that can run over your functions and ensure they are following expected behavior
in a range of practical scenarios.

- [testthat Documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)

## Benchmarking

When writing code, there is often a wide array of ways in which a task can be
completed. Benchmarking your functions can help you find the most efficient
approach possible. This is particularly important when writing scripts and
programs that will be used on large datasets and/or on high performance
computers.
