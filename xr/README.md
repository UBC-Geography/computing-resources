title: XR - Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality
---

Extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality
(AR), and mixed reality (MR), is a collection of rapidly growing technologies
with an increasing number of applications being researched and deployed in the
field of geography.

## Development Tools and Frameworks

XR development has and continues to be a complex and specialized field often
requiring in-depth knowledge of game development, 3D modelling, and programming
languages like C# or JavaScript. When developing content for XR, identify the
goals of your project and consult
[UBC's Emerging Media Lab](https://eml.ubc.ca/){target="\_blank"} to get
assistance with setting a clear scope and connecting with partners.

360 images and video are often a good place to get started with VR content as
they can be easier to create and accessible to wider audiences while still
providing an immersive experience.

For AR, review platforms, like [Echoes](https://echoes.xyz/){target="\_blank"},
which provide interfaces and support for developing and distributing virtual
tours.

### WebXR

WebXR is a new set of standards that enable VR and AR content to be rendered via
web browsers. In some browsers, like Firefox and Safari, WebXR is still flagged
as experimental, but it can be enabled through adjustments in settings.

  Three.js, and A-Frame_ :
  [UBC Library](https://go.exlibris.link/xkKTvLbB){target="\_blank"} |
  [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1238205512){target="\_blank"}

Different frameworks have been in development over the past few years to help
simplify developing VR content with WebXR and its now obsolete predecessor,
WebVR.

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/){target="\_blank"} - A popular, HTML and
  JavaScript-based framework for developing web-based VR content.

### Unity

Unity provides provides a powerful editor game engine for developing AR and VR
applications. Multiple software development kits have been developed to extend
its functionality and cohesively work with GIS software.

### Godot

While lacking the maturity, ease-of-use, and breadth of GIS integrations
compared to Unity, the Godot game engine is an increasingly popular choice for
AR and VR development in both commercial and academic settings due to it being a
powerful, free and open-source option.
[LandscapeLab](https://landscapelab.boku.ac.at){target="\_blank"} provides an
excellent example of how the engine can be applied within a geography-centered
setting.
