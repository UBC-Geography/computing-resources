title: Object Storage
---

Object storage, also known as blob storage or even S3 storage in the context of
cloud computing as it has become synonymous with Amazon's Simple Storage Service
(S3), can provide a cheap and easy-to-implement solution for storing and sharing
files of widely varying sizes.

Cloud-based object storage can fluently handle file uploads when working with
extraordinarily large files while reducing opportunities for data loss by
providing an extremely high level of redundancy and durability. Once files are
stored in an object storage bucket/container, they can be made publicly
available without needing to setup and configure a web server.

Common use cases include:

- Storing and serving geospatial datasets, particularly those that are
  [cloud-optimized](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/){target="\_blank"}

- Backing up research data

- Storing and hosting media assets (images, audio, video, etc.)

- Hosting static websites generated by tools like Jekyll, CollectionBuilder, or
  Quarto

## S3-Compatible Clients

Most cloud-based object storage providers support Amazon's S3 API meaning that
they can be accessed and managed via an S3-compatible client. If you are using
multiple cloud storage providers, these are helpful tool to get familiar with.

## UBC ARC Chinook

UBC faculty members can access object storage via UBC ARC's Chinook platform.
Overall storage capacity is determined by allocation awards while individual
files stored on the platform can be up to 5 TB. While Globus remains the
recommended tool for managing object storage on Chinook, an S3 API can be
enabled upon request thus giving you the ability to use the noted S3 clients
above.

For more details about Chinook, see:
[Research Data Storage](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/research-data-management/research-data-storage.html#ubc-chinook){target="\_blank"}

## Digital Research Alliance (DRA)

Faculty across Canada can also access up to 10 TB of object storage via DRA
Cloud's Arbutus data centre (University of Victoria) by submitting a
[Rapid Access Service (RAS) request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU_BoRk5cEz3AvVLf3e9yZJq-OvcFCQ-mg7p4AWXmUkd5rTw/viewform){target="\_blank"}.
If those limits are not sufficient, additional resources can be requested
through the annual Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) with applications due
between late September and early November. Upon approval, RAC resources are
granted the following April.

You can additionally use the RAS request form to share access to your Arbutus
storage with other Alliance users, including sponsored staff and graduate
students.

::: {.callout-note}

The Alliance doesn't provide backups or redundancy for object storage, so if
plan on storing any data on Arbutus be sure to retain at least one copy on your
local machine and preferably another copy on a local backup drive.

- [DRA - Arbutus Object Storage](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Arbutus_object_storage){target="\_blank"}

Once the Alliance has fulfilled your RAS request and allocated you with a new
project. You'll be able start managing your project by signing in to the
[Arbutus Dashboard](https://arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca){target="\_blank"}
using your Alliance username and password.

Before you can start uploading files, you'll need to first create a new
container. You can think of a container as a folder or directory in which you'll
be storing your uploaded files. Within the Arbutus Dashboard, the button for
creating a new container can be found under Project > Object Store > Containers.
When you create a new container, you'll be prompted to provide a container name,
select a storage policy, and identify whether the container should be public.

![DRA - Arbutus Dashboard - Create container](/assets/images/OpenStack-Object-CreateContainer.PNG)

Arbutus uses container names when generating URLs for all files stored within
it. This means your container name will need to be unique and should be
URL-friendly. A good example of a container name avoids symbols and spaces to
ensure generated URLs avoid unnecessary encoding and are easier to read while
also noting if the contents of the container are public and open for anyone to
view via their URL.

Once a container has been created, you can select it and start uploading files
using the upload button and begin creating sub-folders to help organize your
files.

![DRA - Arbutus Dashboard - Upload files to container](/assets/images/OpenStack-Object-UploadToContainer.PNG)

The Arbutus Dashboard can work well for completing basic tasks like creating new
containers and uploading small individual files, but for more advanced use
cases, like needing to upload files that exceed 500 MB or wanting to upload
multiple files at once, you'll want to install one of the S3-compatible clients
listed above or alternatively an OpenStack Swift
[connector](https://cyberduck.io/openstack/){target="\_blank"} or client.

### Cyberduck OpenStack Swift Connector

Cyberduck provides one of the easiest-to-use clients for connecting to Arbutus
Object Storage on Windows or MacOS.

By default, Cyberduck does not include the OpenStack Swift connector, but it can
be easily added within Cyberduck, by navigating to Edit > Preferences.. >
Profiles and then checking 'OpenStack Swift (Keystone 3)'.

![Cyberduck - Add OpenStack Swift Connector](/assets/images/Arbutus-Cyberduck-Connector.PNG)

You'll then be able open a new connection to Arbutus using that connector and
the Identity API with the following values:

- Connector: OpenStack Swift (Keystone 3)
- Server: arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca
- Port: 5000
- Project:Domain:Username: \<your_project_name\>:CCDB:\<your_Alliance_username\>
- Password: \<your_Alliance_password\>

![Cyberduck - Open Connection to Arbutus Object Storage](/assets/images/Arbutus-Cyberduck-Connection.PNG)

### [OpenStack Swift Client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/cli/index.html)

OpenStack provides an official client for Swift services that can be installed
via Python. This tool is not recommended for Windows environments, but it can
provide a powerful CLI tool for MacOS and Linux users who are familiar with the
Bash shell.

```bash
# Install the openstack-swift CLI tool via Python
python -m pip install openstack-swift
# Download OpenStack RC File from the DRA OpenStack Dashboard via Project -> API Access -> Download OpenStack RC File
# Store your DRA Project credentials as environment variables with the downloaded shell script
source <project name>-openrc.sh
# Start uploading files/directories to your object storage container/bucket
swift upload <your_container_name> <path_to_directory>
```

## QGIS - Accessing Objects (Files) in a Private Container/Bucket

While any data stored in a public container/bucket can easily be accessed and
imported into QGIS using an HTTPS URL, private data can also be accessed given
QGIS has access to your object storage credentials.

### OpenStack Swift

Similarly to using the OpenStack Swift client, you'll need to download your
OpenStack RC file from the dashboard by navigating to Project -> API Access ->
Download OpenStack RC File. The RC file will include important and sensitive
authentication information so be sure to properly secure it. You will need to
extract the environment variables held in this file and enter them into QGIS by
opening Settings -> Options... -> System -> Environment. Be sure to check the
box to use custom variables and start copying in the variables from the RC file.

![QGIS Settings with custom environment variables](/assets/images/qgis_s3.PNG)

Once you have copied your credentials, you will need to restart QGIS. You can
then load a file from your OpenStack container by adding the layer using the
OpenStack Swift Object Storage protocol type along with providing the name of
the container in which the file is stored and the name of the file as the object
key (note: if the file is stored in a subdirectory, the name of the directory
will need to be included)

### S3-Compatible

The process for using an S3-compatible object storage provider, is similar to
that listed above, but instead of using an OpenStack RC file and environment
variables, you will need to set the following custom environment variables in
QGIS, which can be attained from any S3-compatible object storage provider.

- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

Finally, while importing your file as a layer, you will need to use the AWS S3
protocol type.

## Commercial Cloud Object Storage Providers

If neither the Alliance Cloud or Chinook provide sufficient features or you plan
on using a particular cloud computing service that is only available through a
commercial cloud provider, you can access object storage directly through
commercial cloud providers.
