Julia is a relatively young languages that is slowly seeing increased usage
among various research fields. In relation to geospatial computing, the language
lacks the same breadth of packages that can be found in Python or R, but it's
increased performance and support for parallelization may make it useful when
analyzing extraordinarily large datasets, especially in HPC environments.

## Formatting

Sometimes writing code can get a bit messy. Formatters can automatically
reformat your code to make it cleaner and easier to read while following a set
of standards and best practices.

## Testing

Unit testing can be a helpful tool when writing large and complex scripts or
programs. Julia enables you to define tests that can run over your functions and
ensure they are following expected behavior in a range of practical scenarios
via its standard library.
