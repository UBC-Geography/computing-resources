# Git & GitHub

Implementing version control is a commonly used best practice among programmers,
and its usage is strongly encouraged for researchers whether they are working
with large codebases or small Jupyter Notebooks. Version control is especially
helpful when collaborating with other researchers or developers as it enables
changes to be tracked coherently and new code to be explored separately from a
stable, main codebase in easily managed branches.

## Git

Git is by far the most popular version control system and comes with a powerful
command line interface while integrating with code sharing and development
platforms, like GitHub and GitLab.

## GitHub

GitHub is a popular platform for sharing source code and Jupyter Notebooks as
Git repositories. These can either be public and shared broadly with other users
to copy (clone) or private for restricted sharing among invited users. UBC LT
provides access to GitHub Enterprise which can securely share repositories among
students within a single course or with other UBC collaborators.

GitHub Desktop provides a helpful graphical user interface that can help in
managing local Git repositories and pushing changes to remote repositories on
GitHub.
