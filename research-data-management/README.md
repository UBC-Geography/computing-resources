## Security & Privacy

Ensuring research data security and privacy is a critical element to consider
and plan for when starting any new research project. An increasing number of
grants are now requiring that researchers clearly identify the risks associated
with their research data along with clear procedures and safeguards that will be
in place to mitigate and address those risks. To take a proactive approach,
researchers must require that cybersecurity best practices are strictly followed
at the points in which data is collected, stored, accessed, and processed.

UBC researchers that plan to collect and store research information should
consider contacting UBC Advanced Research Computing (ARC) for guidance and
support to ensure data is properly protected. Furthermore, if the research
encompasses any data that could be considered sensitive, contacting ARC is
**STRONGLY** recommended.

### Access

UBC Geog IT provides direct support to faculty and research assistants to ensure
that local hardware is compliant with UBC's standards for securely accessing
research data. This includes ensuring laptops and desktops have full disk
encryption, access control for system administration, and installation of UBC
IT-provided malware protection. Additionally, researchers with machines
connected to Geography's local network have additional protection through
multiple firewalls.

Maintaining secure computing environments is a collaborative process though, and
ultimately, it is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure that any
machines that are used for accessing their project's research data, including
those used by their research assistants, are effectively secured. Part of this
includes ensuring machines are protected with a password or passphrase that
complies with [ISS U2](https://cio.ubc.ca/information-security-standards/U2),
have been setup to automatically lock after, at most, 30 minutes of inactivity,
and receive routine updates to the operating system and any installed
software[^1]. Depending on the risk levels associated with a researcher's data,
the restrictions noted above may need to be more stringent.

Before sharing research data with recently hired research assistant, ensure that
they have completed the following UBC training modules.

- [Introduction to Research Security](https://wpl.ubc.ca/browse/vpri/researchsecurity/courses/introduction-to-research-security)

### Collection & Storage

Even if a project does not include Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or
other sensitive data,
[classifying research information](https://arc.ubc.ca/security-privacy/research-information-classification)
that will be collected, stored, and analyzed through the lifetime of a research
project is an important to step to identify and assess risk levels that may be
associated with the project.

- [DigItal Research Alliance - Data Protection, Privacy, and Confidentiality](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Data_protection,_privacy,_and_confidentiality)

Both UBC IT and UBC ARC provide tools and services, like REDCap for data
collection and OneDrive for data storage, which are thoroughly reviewed to
ensure compliance when working for sensitive data. Any tools that rely on
external service providers will need to go through a Security Threat Risk
Assessment (STRA) to ensure that the tool complies with privacy legislation and
effectively mitigates known security threats.

UBC ARC's
[REDCap Security and Privacy](https://arc.ubc.ca/security-privacy/arc-redcap-security-and-privacy)
provides a good example of the kind of information that would be gathered and
documented through an STRA.

## Data Collection Systems

For survey or form-based data collection, UBC researchers can access either of
two FIPPA-compliant systems, REDCap, which is managed by UBC's Advanced Research
Computing (ARC) team, or Qualtrics, which is a vendor-supported cloud service
that UBC IT manages a subscription for.

### [REDCap](https://arc.ubc.ca/software/redcap){target="\_blank"}

REDCap is ideal for academic research, particularly when working with sensitive
data and/or running a long-term research project. Many academic institutions
support their own REDCap instances, and it's often used for medical research.
For offline data collection, REDCap provides a
[mobile app](https://projectredcap.org/software/mobile-app/){target="\_blank"}.

### [UBC Survey Tool (Qualtrics)](https://it.ubc.ca/services/teaching-learning-tools/survey-tool){target="\_blank"}

Qualtrics works best for quickly developing surveys for assessments or
short-term research projects. It provides a ton of features alongside a modern
and user-friendly interface. A
[mobile app](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/distributions-module/mobile-distributions/offline-app/setting-up-the-offline-app/){target="\_blank"}
is also available for offline data entry.

### [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org){target="\_blank"}

LimeSurvey is a free and open-source alternative to REDCap and Qualtrics. While
UBC researchers do not have direct access to LimeSurvey, an instance can be
easily deployed via a VM on the Alliance Cloud infrastructure. Generally, REDCap
and Qualtrics are better options, but LimeSurvey can be a helpful tool to be
aware of when collaborating with small organization who need to retain ownership
and access to collected research data.

## Recommended GIS and Geospatial File Formats

GIS software and other geospatial computing software and packages can support a
wide array of file formats for vector and raster data thanks in large part to
the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). When creating, enhancing, and/or
storing geospatial data, it is important to carefully select a format that best
meets the needs of your project. The formats listed below focus on cases that
may require broad usability among various GIS platforms and software,
preservation, and performance.

- [ArcGIS - Best Practices - Imagery Formats and Performance](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/imagery/workflows/best-practices/imagery-formats-and-performance.htm){target="\_blank"}

### Vector

#### [OGC GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/){target="\_blank"}

Developed and maintained as an OGC standard, GeoPackage has become a broadly
supported format for storing and transferring GIS data. In addition to vector
data, it can also store raster data. This is the recommended and default format
for vector data in QGIS.

#### [ESRI File Geodatabase (FileGDB)](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/manage-file-gdb/file-geodatabases.htm){target="\_blank"}

Created by ESRI, the File Geodatabase format has been developed as an
alternative to Shapefile with the intention to overcome some of its shortcomings
and act as a possible successor.

#### [ESRI Shapefile](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/shapefiles/working-with-shapefiles-in-arcgis-pro.htm){target="\_blank"}

By far the most popular vector format, Shapefile was developed by ESRI in the
90's and has continued to be maintained by them. While the format is not fully
open, it has nevertheless found an extraordinary level of support among GIS and
other geospatial software.

#### [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/){target="\_blank"}

GeoJSON provides a lightweight format that can be easily read and written via
JavaScript. This format is particularly well-suited for web mapping and easily
integrates with web mapping libraries, like Leaflet and OpenLayers.

#### [FlatGeobuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/){target="\_blank"}

A relatively new format that has shown significant performance improvements
compared to the formats listed above. FlatGeobuf currently lacks the backing of
standardization, but it has found broad support in geospatial packages and
software. It is also currently under review as a proposed OGC Community
Standard.

#### [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/){target="\_blank"}

Similar to FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet has recently seen a stable release with
significant performance improvements compared to GeoPackage and Shapefile, and
it is quickly finding support among GIS and other geospatial computing software.
This format is open-source, but has yet to reach standardization. Its developers
intend to propose it for adoption as an OGC standard.

### Raster

#### [GeoTIFF](https://www.ogc.org/standard/geotiff/){target="\_blank"} and [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/){target="\_blank"}

GeoTIFF has become the dominant format for raster data used in GIS and other
geospatial computing due in large part to its development on open-source
standards. It is also often the default and recommended format in libraries like
GDAL and GIS software like QGIS. The format has been further improved thanks to
the development of Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COG), which enhances the capacity
of GeoTIFF for cloud computing and access via the web. COG files can be stored
and easily accessed via S3 object stores, like that supported by UBC ARC Chinook
and the DRA's Arbutus Object Storage.

Built atop the TIFF file format, GeoTIFFs also support multiple compression
algorithms that can significantly reduce their overall file size. Understanding
and using these algorithms effectively can maximize computing resources while
also mitigating any unnecessary data loss.

##### Uncompressed vs Lossless vs Lossy

GeoTIFFs can often be distributed without any compression at all. While the
clear drawback to this approach is extraordinarily large file sizes, there can
be benefits in ensuring that files do not need to be either encoded or decoded,
which requires varying levels of computing time and in some cases libraries that
are not supported by commonly used operating systems or software.

On the other hand, GeoTIFFs can be compressed using lossy algorithms, with the
most common being JPEG. Applying a lossy algorithm can significantly reduce
overall file sizes, but it comes with a large drawback, varying levels of data
loss. A GeoTIFF that is compressed using JPEG will always lose some data, even
if the compression quality is set to 100.

Lossless compression provides a valuable middle ground between lossy compression
and using no compression at all. A GeoTIFF that uses lossless compression can
see varying levels of reduction in file size based on the raster data and
compression algorithm used. Again a single drawback is that encoding and
decoding a large lossless file can require varying amounts of computing time.
Encoding files on powerful machines can reduce encoding times while serving
files as COGs can help reduce some of the decoding time as only the needed
portions of the file will be downloaded and decoded by end users.

The Translate tool found in the GDAL library is the most commonly used tool for
creating GeoTIFFs and COGs, and it supports a broad set of
[compression algorithms](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html#general-creation-options){target="\_blank"}.
The following algorithms are important to note:

- [LZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch){target="\_blank"} -
  This is a lossless algorithm with broad support, and it's the current default
  used by GDAL. While it can be relatively fast, this algorithm is not optimized
  for raster data, so reductions in file size may be minimal. Nevertheless, when
  in doubt, this is the algorithm to choose.

- [LERC](https://esri.github.io/lerc/){target="\_blank"} - Developed and
  maintained by Esri, this algorithm has been optimized for raster data and can
  support either lossy or lossless compression. While lacking the level of
  support provided by LZW or JPEG, this algorithm is relatively fast and
  provides a valuable middle ground between the two.

- [JPEG](https://jpeg.org/jpeg/){target="\_blank"} - Well supported and backed
  by solid, open-source standards, this has been the defacto lossy algorithm for
  raster data over the past 30 years. This a solid choice if you are looking to
  display a raster on the web and require broad support across web browsers and
  other software.

- [WEBP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/){target="\_blank"} - While it
  is well supported by modern web browsers, this algorithm is not developed on
  open-source standards. It supports both lossy and lossless compression. It
  also provides improved compression ratios over JPEG and currently provides the
  best option for displaying a raster on the web, but it lacks broader support
  in other software and will likely be replaced by JXL in the future.

- [JXL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/index.html){target="\_blank"} - This is still a
  relatively new standard that has been developed as a successor to JPEG and
  JPEG2000. Similar to LERC and WEBP, it supports both lossy and lossless
  compression, but it is capable of reaching significantly better compression
  ratios at the expense of slower encoding and decoding times. It also has yet
  to reach similar levels of support as JPEG or LZW and not all distributions of
  GDAL include the necessary library to use this algorithm, but it is well worth
  monitoring in the future as its support grows.
