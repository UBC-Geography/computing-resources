This repository includes a listing of computing resources and accompanying
documentation that can be helpful in familiarizing oneself with various tools
and software that are used in Geography research, instruction, and learning.

For in-depth workshop opportunities relevant to these resources and other useful
materials, check out the following resources:

- [UBC Library Research Commons Workshops](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/workshops/)

- [UBC Library Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/gis)

- [UBC Geospatial Resources](https://gis.ubc.ca/)

- [Earth Lab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/)

- [The Turing Way - handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science](https://book.the-turing-way.org/)

If you are a faculty member within our department, and you are seeking
information on acquiring local computing hardware, you can can contact the
Geography IT team for advice and support in procuring, setting up, and
maintaining laptops and workstations.

For research computing, review
[Cloud Computing](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/cloud-computing/)
and
[High-Performance Computing (HPC) / High-Throughput Computing (HTC)](https://ubc-geography.github.io/computing-resources/high-performance-computing/)
to identify available resources through UBC Advanced Research Computing and the
Digital Research Alliance.

And for instructional use, our department hosts and manages two
[computer labs](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/) that are
specialized to fit the instructional needs of our faculty. Additionally, UBC
Learning Technology (LT) Hub maintains a
[JupyterHub instance](https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca) that can be remotely accessed
via a web browser and is open to all UBC students. Each student is allocated a
single CPU core, 3 GB of RAM, and 10 GB of storage in an environment where
programming languages, like Python, R, and Julia are pre-installed to run
scripts and computational notebooks.
